WEB SERVER
----------
Used to verify some features, nodejs is required. See readme in \test\README.md for more information.

Webserver can be started by executing: \test\webserver\start_test_server.cmd

- Q: Why don't we use local html files?
- A: Because they are treated differently (compared to remotely served files) by Firefox


CODING STYLE
------------
We follow w3schools.com's style guide and coding conventions, see http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp.

Additionally all pages are coded in order to conform with strict mode, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode.


DESIGN DECISIONS
----------------

* Options Dialog
** Grid:
    - We do not use DataTables because the inline editing capablilities are limited
      - Positive: can load JSON / JavaScript arrays
      
    - We use http://www.webismymind.be/editablegrid/ instead.
      - Drawback: can only load XML (no JavaScript arrays)
      
      
DOCUMENTATION
-------------
We use JSDoc for documentation, see http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/DocExamples
