This version didn't pass full review because of the following issues:

1) I get the following errors in the Error Console at startup:

Error: jQuery is not defined

Source code:
        return '<input type="checkbox" id="checkboxUrlEnabled' + obj.iDataRow + '"' + checked + '/> 

   It would incidentally be a good idea to ensure that your HTML files are well formed XHTML and change the extensions to .xhtml

You should also remove or disable the unused code in your showPathInWindowsExplorer function.

You need to correct them to get full approval. Thanks.
