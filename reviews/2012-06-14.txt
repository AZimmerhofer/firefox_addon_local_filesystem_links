Comments:
This version has been approved for the public. Due to caching and mirroring on our site, it can take a few hours before this change is visible, so please be patient.

However, I have the following issues which should be addressed before your next update:

1) Please remove or comment the no longer used code in exports.showPathInWindowsExplorer which searches for the location of Windows Explorer and prepares for nsIProcess.
